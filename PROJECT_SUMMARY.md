- Made initial commit with all project files
- Pushed to GitHub repository: `git@github.com:Nazuna-io/storyspark-agent.git`

### 2. Codebase Analysis ✅
- Analyzed the entire project structure
- Identified 6 main modules:
  - `main.py`: Entry point and scheduler
  - `data_fetcher.py`: RSS and Reddit data collection
  - `trend_detector.py`: Keyword analysis and spark detection
  - `story_seed_generator.py`: Gemini AI integration
  - `config_loader.py`: Configuration management
  - `logger_config.py`: Logging setup

### 3. Test Coverage ✅
- Created comprehensive test suites for all modules
- Achieved **72% code coverage** (exceeding the 70% target)
- Tests cover:
  - Data fetching from RSS feeds and Reddit
  - Trend detection algorithms
  - Story seed generation with AI
  - Configuration loading
  - Logging setup
  - Main orchestration logic

### 4. Code Review ✅
The codebase follows good practices:
- **Modular architecture**: Clear separation of concerns
- **Error handling**: Comprehensive try-catch blocks
- **Type hints**: Used throughout for better code clarity
- **Logging**: Well-structured logging with rotation
- **Configuration**: Externalized configuration via YAML
- **Documentation**: Clear docstrings and comments

### 5. Security Review ✅

- API key management analysis
- Input validation assessment
- Error handling evaluation
- External API security review
- Data storage security
- Logging security
- Dependency management recommendations

Key findings:
- No critical vulnerabilities
- Good security practices overall
- Recommendations for improvements provided

### 6. Documentation Updates ✅
- Updated `README.md` with:
  - Clear project description
  - Quick start guide
  - Configuration instructions
  - Architecture overview
  - Development guidelines
  - Example output

### 7. CI/CD Setup ✅
- Created GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/test.yml`)
- Configured multi-version Python testing (3.8-3.11)
- Added coverage reporting with Codecov integration
